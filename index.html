    <h2>What is ConflictCompass?</h2>
        <p>ConflictCompass is a political compass test that utilizes past, present, and possible future conflicts to evaluate users' ideology on a three-axis scale. The core code is forked from SapplyValues via ThreeDimension.</p>
        <p>There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Why the changes in the axes?</h2>
    <p>Conflict is an interesting area to consider because context matters. This test considers democracy, dictatorship, tolerance for aggression, and tolerance for violence against populations and cultures (up to and including acts of genocide).
    </p>
    <h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
    <p> One of the main reasons I developed this test was to highlight the fact that a lot of people who think they support democracy and peace nevertheless support aggressive and genocidal dictatorships. If you are uncomfortable with the degree to which the test indicates you support genocide, aggression, or dictatorship, I recommend you reconsider your moral priorities.</p>
    <p> If you think there are important test cases missing, you are welcome to suggest them!</p>
    <p> If you think that a question is scored incorrectly, please refer first to publicly available reference material on the subject before sending in a suggested correction. In general, I have avoided assigning a genocide, aggression, or democracy subscore for questions where significant ambiguity exists.</p>
    <p> It's not possible to score "perfect" values in multiple dimensions of this test because there are questions that are scored for both democracy and aggression - that is to say, none of the four corners are possible scores! These questions are not balanced in both diagonal directions, but neither is the historical record.</p>
